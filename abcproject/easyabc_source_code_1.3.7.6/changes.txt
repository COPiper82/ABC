double-clicking on the Play button causes the playback to loop
if a file starts with %abc-2.1 it implies that it's utf-8 encoded
assistance for files that do not contain abc-charset or %abc-2.1
  when saving if they contain extended letters for which utf-8 is needed

General information:
-------------------
EasyABC supports playback and preview of the edited tunes and features syntax highlighting of ABC code. It also supports a customized MIDI to ABC import. By not relying on midi2abc it's possible to create better formatted ABC code. There is also support for MusicXML to ABC conversion (only a reasonable subset of MusicXML is supported).
